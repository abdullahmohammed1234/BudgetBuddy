## Project Theme 
**Financial Clarity for Everyday Decision-Making**

BudgetBuddy simplifies budgeting by combining educational AI reasoning with clear visual guidance without financial risk.

## Problem Statement

Students and young adults often want to manage their money better but struggle to do so because they feel overwhelmed by rigid breakdowns, unreasonable goals, and financial anxiety. Additionally, advise given can feel unfit for their personal situation. Tracking expenses can create stress rather than clarity and reassurance. As a result, many end up spending against their initially intended budget, or avoid budgeting apps altogether, failing to build consistent saving habits.

## Solution Overview

BudgetBuddy turns financial confusion into confidence. It provides personalized monthly budgets, category-based spending guidance, and simple visual progress tracking. Every recommendation comes with a clear explanation, so users understand the reasoning behind their decisions.

## User Disclaimers

BudgetBuddy is an assistive and educational tool, not a financial advisor or predictive system. All budgeting decisions remain the sole responsibility of the user. The app provides guidance and explanations to support informed decision-making, but does not replace professional financial advice.

## Tech Stack

BudgetBuddy’s web frontend is built with Next.js, using Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Lucide Icons, Framer Motion, and Chart.js to handle layouts, components, animations, and charts. The mobile app is developed in Flutter, with a shared design system to keep the experience consistent across platforms. 

The backend runs on Python and FastAPI. Google Gemini 3 Pro powers the Tips section, offering budget allocation reasoning, category recommendations, and plain-language financial explanations. 

Data storage and authentication are handled through Firebase Firestore and Firebase Auth, supporting both email, password and Google sign-in.

## Future Endeavors 

As it continues to evolve, BudgetBuddy aims to soon offer clearer insights, smarter planning, and deeper personalization over time, making budgeting feel more intuitive at every step. In the future, BudgetBuddy strives to securely connect with users’ personal banking and serve as a free, integrated budgeting tool available to students through their school portals, like SFU.
